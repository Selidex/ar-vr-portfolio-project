# Memory Lane
A common speech memory technique is to imagine yourself at a different point in a place you know well for each part of the speech. For some people, this may be a hole on their favorite golf course. For others, it may be various breakpoints on their favorite hike. In Memory Lane, we want to give users a virtual trail to walk through to memorize their speech.
 
This project uses Unity and OpenXR in order to create an application for the Oculus Quest. Stretch goals include creating an API using firebase so that users can upload custom speeches

> Note: This is a work in progress which will not be completed until the end of April 2022.
